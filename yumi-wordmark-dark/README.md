There are two files:

yumi-wordmark-dark.img

and

yumi-wordmark-dark.zip

If TWRP is installed, choose yumi-wordmark-dark.zip and flash it like you would any other piece of software.
Alternatively, you can download and run yumi-wordmark-dark.sh in a terminal to auto-install it.

If you do NOT see it, you may have flashed the .zip file with fastboot, or the .img file with TWRP. Make sure you flash the right one. You may not have powered the device off after running the command, instead just selecting "Start". Reboot the device and you should see it.
