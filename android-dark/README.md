There are two files:

android-dark.img

and

android-dark.zip

If TWRP is installed, choose android-dark.zip and flash it like you would any other piece of software.

Or, you can download and run android-dark.sh in the terminal and it will automatically flash the graphic for you.

If you do NOT see it, you may have flashed the .zip file with fastboot, or the .img file with TWRP. Make sure you flash the right one. You may not have powered the device off after running the command, instead just selecting "Start". Reboot the device and you should see it.
